> **<ruby>見<rt>み</rt>に</ruby> /mi·ni/** — _with intent to see_ [^etymology]

[^etymology]: From 見に行く (mi-ni iku), meaning "to go for the purpose of seeing something." This library is about small AI experiments—quick, lightweight explorations to try and see what happens.

mi-ni is a template repository and library for doing AI research. Features:

- **Local Python notebooks**
- **Remote per-function GPU compute** [^modal]
- **Inline visualization** with remote-to-local callbacks
- **AI-assisted coding** with Copilot/VS Code

[See z0u/mi-ni](https://github.com/z0u/mi-ni).

## Published notebooks

Notebooks are automatically published to GitHub Pages, including assets stored in Git LFS. But if this site was built from the _template itself_, the notebooks won't include results.
